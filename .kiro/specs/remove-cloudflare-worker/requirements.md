# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves removing all Cloudflare Worker related code from the project. The current implementation includes a Cloudflare Worker for code verification and a Next.js API route that communicates with it. This cleanup will remove the worker code, the API route, and any related functionality to simplify the codebase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove the Cloudflare Worker verification system, so that the codebase is simplified and no longer depends on external worker services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the `cloudflare-worker` directory SHALL be completely removed
2. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the `src/pages/api/verify-code.ts` file SHALL be removed
3. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN there SHALL be no references to `workers.dev` URLs in the codebase
4. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN there SHALL be no broken imports or references to the removed files

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure no orphaned code remains, so that the codebase remains clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching the codebase THEN there SHALL be no references to the removed worker functionality
2. WHEN searching the codebase THEN there SHALL be no references to `/api/verify-code` endpoints
3. WHEN the project builds THEN there SHALL be no build errors related to missing files
4. WHEN the project runs THEN there SHALL be no runtime errors related to missing verification functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify any components that might have used the verification system, so that I can decide whether to remove or modify them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing components THEN any components that reference verification functionality SHALL be identified
2. WHEN components are identified THEN they SHALL be reviewed for potential removal or modification
3. WHEN components are modified THEN they SHALL maintain their core functionality without verification dependencies
4. WHEN components are removed THEN no broken references SHALL remain in the codebase
